Projects - Tareq Abd El Razik
I independently developed all of these projects.

You will find a list of the required libraries needed to run them.

Machine learning :
  
    Data Manipulation: NumPy, Pandas
  
    Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (various ML modules) 
  
    Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
    Data Handling: Pickle, DateTime
  
    Handling Imbalanced Data: Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

For the machine learning project, I recommend using Google Colab, as I built it there, and all the necessary libraries are already installed.

Note: 

1) The dataset for the machine learning project is available on GitHub.
2) I droped a lot of the features because i have been asked to.



Sudoku Solver :
    numpy: Used for handling grids and arrays in Sudoku.
  
    multiprocessing: Used for parallel processing, which can help speed up the solving process.
  
    random: Used for generating random Sudoku puzzles and shuffling solutions.
  
    tkinter & customtkinter: A standard GUI in Python for creating the application interface.
  
    pygame: Typically used for creating games but Used only for sounds.

Note: it won't work without customtkinter and pygame installed , therefore these are the commands for runing them 
  
     pip install pygame
   
     pip install customtkinter
